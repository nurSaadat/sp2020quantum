The problem is when inserting toffoli gates, we want to bring all three into the proximity (if we are relying on the IBM decomposition, which we do as of now)
So the skeleton should change to accomodate [ a,b,c] as missing edges
The fixMissingEdges should be modified accordingly
We also need to realize  that for toffoli we have hard requirement all three being around
Alternatively, we could stick to our decomposition that uses two bits, but we have got to 
start displaying it in the lines.
